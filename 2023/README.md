# 2023
I completed puzzles for 2023 in C#.
To run them:
1. Create a .NET console app in the 2023 directory and add `<StartupObject>AdventOfCode</StartupObject>` to the csproj file.
2. Create an Inputs directory (under 2023) and add input text files, called input01.txt ... input25.txt
3. Modify AdventOfCode.cs to run specific puzzles

Unfortunately I couldn't continue with it after day 6 because it would've taken up too much time and I had to focus on studying.
I may return to finish them at some point.
